Marinduque. I was born in Tagaytay. Like my older brother, Nelord, my childhood was never at its best since I was a product of a broken family. I was not able to go to college. However, my determination and hard work paid off when I was promoted as supervisor of one of the leading grocery stores in our country. A couple of years after, I decided to work abroad. At the age of 26, I was young and healthy until I felt something strange happening to my eyes during my second contract. I was unusually blinking a lot I often had to use my hands to open my eyes just to see normally. My company had to send me back to the Philippines after being diagnosed with blespharopasm. A few days after I got back, my condition worsened and I was diagnosed with cervical dystonia which later turned out to be the beginnings of my journey with XDP. It was only after then that it was made clear to me that I was afflicted with this disorder because of my motherâ€™s Visayan ancestry.</div><a class="button red" href="index.html">Meet the others</a></div></div></div><div class="section" id="footer-wrapper"><div class="center-wrapper"><div class="left"><div class="logo-wrapper"></div><div class="text-wrapper"><div class="logo-text">Haligi</div><div class="subtitle">Raising awareness on X-Linked Dystonia Parkinsonism Towards Metro Manila-based Patients and their Families</div><div class="credit">This is the senior creative project by Gab Mesina, a graduating BFA Information Design student in  Ateneo de Manila University</div></div></div><div class="right"><div class="item"><div class="logo-wrapper scf"></div><div class="text-wrapper"><div class="title">Sunshine Care Foundation</div><div class="subtitle">Abegail Aguil (+63) 0917 157 1342</div></div></div><div class="item"><div class="logo-wrapper fb"></div><div class="text-wrapper"><div class="title">X-Linked Dystonia Parkinsonism - XDP Philippines</div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
