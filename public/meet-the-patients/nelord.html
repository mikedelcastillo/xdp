I was a product of a broken family since I was 3 years old. I grew up with my grandparents with a promise to send me to school but only until high school and so they did. During those days, we didn’t have enough in terms of finances but I was filled with love by my grandparents. After high school, I stopped studying for a year. The next year, I applied for a scholarship and a job at the same time and luckily I got both. My college days were a bit tougher than the normal student who only goes to school, as I had to be in school in morning and at my job until late at night. During the weekend, I had to work two jobs as I needed to render 8 hours of duty for my scholarship and work again at night. But everything went smoothly as I managed to finish my degree as Cum Laude. Two months after I graduated, I got married but it ended up as a failed marriage but not as a failed parenthood to both of us. We were both okay. My ex-wife and I still talk and see other once in awhile. As a matter of fact, I considered her as one of my best friends ever. However, I don’t know if she feels the same way...hehehe kidding aside, I know I am. With my credentials, I’ve always gotten the job that I wanted. I’d only want what’s best for my son, Gyles Gabriel. Now everything is falling apart as I was stricken by this neurological disorder (XDP) which has disabled me for the past 3 years. Now all I need is your prayers..baka pag mas marami mas mabilis niyang marinig. Thank you and God bless.</div><a class="button red" href="index.html">Meet the others</a></div></div></div><div class="section" id="footer-wrapper"><div class="center-wrapper"><div class="left"><div class="logo-wrapper"></div><div class="text-wrapper"><div class="logo-text">Haligi</div><div class="subtitle">Raising awareness on X-Linked Dystonia Parkinsonism Towards Metro Manila-based Patients and their Families</div><div class="credit">This is the senior creative project by Gab Mesina, a graduating BFA Information Design student in  Ateneo de Manila University</div></div></div><div class="right"><div class="item"><div class="logo-wrapper scf"></div><div class="text-wrapper"><div class="title">Sunshine Care Foundation</div><div class="subtitle">Abegail Aguil (+63) 0917 157 1342</div></div></div><div class="item"><div class="logo-wrapper fb"></div><div class="text-wrapper"><div class="title">X-Linked Dystonia Parkinsonism - XDP Philippines</div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
